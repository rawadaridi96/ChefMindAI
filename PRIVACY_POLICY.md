# Privacy Policy for ChefMind AI

**Last updated:** February 03, 2026

## Introduction

ChefMind AI ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy specifically addresses our practices regarding the collection and use of camera and microphone data, as required by Google Play policies.

## Permissions We Request

To provide the core features of ChefMind AI, we request the following sensitive permissions on your Android device:

### 1. Camera (`android.permission.CAMERA`)

**Why we need it:**

- To enable the **Vision Scanner** feature, allowing you to scan physical ingredients and automatically add them to your pantry.
- To allow you to take and upload photos of your cooked meals to your Personal Vault.

**Data handling:**

- Camera data is processed locally on your device or momentarily sent to our secure servers solely for image recognition (AI analysis).
- We do not store raw camera feeds.
- Images you explicitly save (like recipe photos) are stored securely in your private vault.

### 2. Microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`)

**Why we need it:**

- To enable **Voice Commands** during the hands-free Cooking Mode.
- To allow you to dictate notes or interact with the Chef Assistant via voice.

**Data handling:**

- Audio is processed to convert speech to text.
- We do not record or store your conversations.
- Microphone access is only active when you explicitly trigger the listening mode (e.g., tapping the microphone icon).

## Data Usage and Sharing

- **No Third-Party Ad Tracking:** We do not sell your personal data or camera/audio inputs to third parties for advertising purposes.
- **AI Processing:** Text and image inputs are processed by our AI providers (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI) strictly to generate recipes and analyze ingredients. These inputs are not used to train public AI models without your consent.

## Your Control

You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings (Settings > Apps > ChefMind AI > Permissions). Note that revoking permissions will disable the features mentioned above (Vision Scanner, Voice Commands).
